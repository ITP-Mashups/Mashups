### Classes 11: Database

#### I. Database as a service
* [Skygear](https://skygear.io/)
  * [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.skygear.io/guides/intro/quickstart/js/)
  * [User authentication](https://docs.skygear.io/guides/auth/basics/js/)
  * [Code Example](https://github.com/ITP-Mashups/Mashups/tree/master/11_Database/Skygear)

#### II. Getting your apps online
* There are a number of services that will host your site for free, using their domain namespace, or with your own domain for a small fee:
  * [Forge](https://getforge.com/)
  * [Bitballoon](https://www.bitballoon.com)

#### III. What to turn in next week
  * Your work, hosted somewhere on the internet (you can use github pages, your own server, or one of the services mentioned above). Ideally this will be a permanent link we all can refer back to in the future.
  * A blog post explaining your process and the final outcome

#### IV. In-class exercise: 
  * Work with a partner and discuss your final project with them. Is it in a place where a user can test something? Are you having code issues that you can work through together? Is your design intuitive? Spend at least 15 minutes with each person's work.

#### V. Homework
* For Monday 4/23
  * Finish your final projects!
