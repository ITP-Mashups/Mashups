Github Workflow
------------------

[Understanding Git basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basic)

**Assignment Workflow**  
   1. To start, [**fork** the homework repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).    
   2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the **forked** repository to your computer.    
   3. Modify the files and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) changes to submit your work.   
   4. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.    
   5. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. Do not merge the Pull Request.

   You can use either the [Command Line](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) to execute these steps or the [Github Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/).
