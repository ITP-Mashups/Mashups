#### III. Discussion - Project #1 Due Class 7 (Thursday 07/27)
* Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

#### V. Homework
* Review - [CSS Positioning 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101)
* Watch - [Lynda.com: Javascript Essential Training Section 2 - Core Javascript Syntax (56 mins)](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Read - [MDN - Javascript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)  
* Install - A JS Linter for your Text Editor (I use [Sublime Linter](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/identify-code-errors-sublime-linter/) for Sublime)
* Download the [Postman App](https://www.getpostman.com/) for easy API pinging
* Create - a single web page that displays (some of) the data returned by an API url. Your page must have some basic css styling. You must have an .html file and .css file. Feel free to copy and paste your data into the DOM, you **DO NOT** need to programatically connect your page to the data.
